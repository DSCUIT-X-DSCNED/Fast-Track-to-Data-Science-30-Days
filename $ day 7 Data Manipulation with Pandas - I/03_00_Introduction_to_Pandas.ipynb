        "Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a ``DataFrame``.\n",
        "``DataFrame``s are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data.\n",

        "As we saw, NumPy's ``ndarray`` data structure provides essential features for the type of clean, well-organized data typically seen in numerical computing tasks.\n",
        "While it serves this purpose very well, its limitations become clear when we need more flexibility (e.g., attaching labels to data, working with missing data, etc.) and when attempting operations that do not map well to element-wise broadcasting (e.g., groupings, pivots, etc.), each of which is an important piece of analyzing the less structured data available in many forms in the world around us.\n",
        "Pandas, and in particular its ``Series`` and ``DataFrame`` objects, builds on the NumPy array structure and provides efficient access to these sorts of \"data munging\" tasks that occupy much of a data scientist's time.\n",

        "In this chapter, we will focus on the mechanics of using ``Series``, ``DataFrame``, and related structures effectively.\n",
